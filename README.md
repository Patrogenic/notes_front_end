## Description:
This is the front end to a fairly simple notes application I made. Responsive design was very important to me for this project. As a result, the user will have as good of an experience on mobile as they will on desktop. I use fetch to communicate with my back end for all requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Uses Webpack.
